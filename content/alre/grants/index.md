# AUSTRALIAN LEPIDOPTERA RESEARCH ENDOWMENT 

The Australian Lepidoptera Research Endowment, established by Drs Marianne Horak and Douglas Hilton within the Perpetual Foundation, wishes to support taxonomic and phylogenetic research on Australian moths and butterflies by professional and amateur entomologists and to enhance the curation of the Lepidoptera collection at the Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC). 

## Activities of interest include:
 
* Support for visitors or students to curate parts of the ANIC Lepidoptera collection
* Collecting trips designed to obtain material for specific taxonomic studies
* Molecular, morphological and life-history research to generate data for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies
* Provision of cabinets to amateur collectors to ensure proper housing of material collected or on loan $from Institutions
* Preparation and printing of scientific publications
* Travel and accommodation for international researchers to work in the ANIC to undertake taxonomic research and/or curatorial work enhancing the scientific value of the collection
* Scholarships to support undergraduate, MSc and PhD students undertaking taxonomic and phylogenetic research.

## Grants

A call for applications will be made by the Endowment in January each year and will outline the amount of funding available and the areas that will be considered for support. The deadline for receipt of applications will be 1 March. A decision on which applications to recommend to the trustee to fund from the Endowment will be made by the Scientific Advisory Committee and the trustee will advise successful applicants by 31 May. Researchers must provide the Scientific Advisory Committee with a report showing previously funded research has been completed before becoming eligible for potential new funding. Grant application forms see under Grants. 

## Grants disbursed in 2016

We received five applications for our first funding round and the following three grants were offered and accepted:

1. Thomas Simonsen (Natural History Museum Aarhus, Denmark): Support for colour plates in his volume The splendid Ghost Moths and their allies in Australia (Hepialidae) of the series Monographs on Australian Lepidoptera.
 
2. Jay Sohn (Mokpo National University, South Korea): Funding to extract accession material and to curate the Yponomeutidae at the ANIC in the context of a taxonomic revision of the Australian Yponomeutidae.
 
3. Liz Milla (University of Melbourne): Field work support for her Ph. D. project Evolution and Ecology of the Australian Heliozelidae.
 
All three projects will clearly profit the ANIC, and the Scientific Advisory Committee was delighted at just how much can be done with at the moment still quite moderate funding.

## ​Grants disbursed in 2017


We received three applications for our second funding round and managed to fund all three grants:
 

1.  Liz Milla (University of Melbourne): Support for field work for her Ph.D. project ‘Evolution and Ecology of the Australian Heliozelidae’.
 

1.  Andy Young (Nature Foundation SA): Support for field work for his project ‘Revision of the False Boronia Moths (Yponomeutidae, Praydinae) of Western Australia.
 

1.  Adam Kiss (University of Debrecen, Hungary): Curating and extracting material from the ANIC for his project ‘Reviewing the Australian Acronictinae species with regard to the revision of Craniophora’.

​

## Grants disbursed in 2018
​
We received only two applications for the third funding round, and they were both funded:
 

1.  Timothy Lee (with support by Andrew Mitchell) (Australian Museum, Sydney): Phylogeny and taxonomic review of Bathytricha Turner 1920 and Australian species of Acrapex Hampson 1894 (Noctuidae: Amphipyrinae (of Checklist): Apameini).
 
1.  Adam Kiss (University of Debrecen, Hungary): Taxonomic study on the Australian Acronictinae and Amphipyrinae species (Noctuidae).
​

## Grants disbursed in 2019
 

1. Peter Mackey (CSIRO ANIC): Support for visiting the Australian Museum for his revision of the Australian Lymantriinae for a Monograph volume.
 

1.  Michael Moore and Ethan Beaver (South Australian Museum, Adelaide): Support for visiting Australian collections for their revision of the ‘oxycanine’ hepialids of Australia.
 

1.  Jon Finch (University of Western Sydney): Funding for field work for his study Epicephala moths (Gracillariidae) and their hosts (Phyllantaceae).
 

1. Andy Young (Nature Foundation SA Inc.): Funding for field work on Micropterigidae in WA.
 

1. Georgina Binns (Macquarie University): Contribution towards molecular taxonomic resolution of the Amata nigriceps complex

​
## Grants disbursed in 2020

1. Jon Finch (Western Sydney University): Funding for field and lab work for his study on Epicephala moths (Gracillariidae) and their hosts (Phyllantaceae).

1. Peter McQuillan (Tasmanian Land Conservancy): Funding for field work for a revision of the Gallaba group (Notodontidae).

1.  Peter Mackey: Funding for visit to the ANIC to dissect lymantriine types borrowed from The Natural History Museum, London, which have to be dissected at the ANIC. 

Obviously, any parts of these projects involving travel could not be undertaken within the projected time frame.


## Grants disbursed in 2021

1.  Peter McQuillan (Tasmania Land Conservancy): An enduring enigma: towards a resolution of the Common Gum Emerald.

1.  Ted Edwards, Glenn Cocking, Suzi Bond and Andras Keszei (ANIC, CSIRO): Publication of a field guide to the moths of the ANIC.
