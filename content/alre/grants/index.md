# AUSTRALIAN LEPIDOPTERA RESEARCH ENDOWMENT 

The Australian Lepidoptera Research Endowment, established by Drs Marianne Horak and Douglas Hilton within the [Perpetual Foundation](https://www.perpetual.com.au/), wishes to support taxonomic and phylogenetic research on Australian moths and butterflies by professional and amateur entomologists, and to enhance the curation of the Lepidoptera collection at the [Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC)](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/collections/anic). 
 

## Applications for Funding

A call for applications will be made by the Endowment in January each year and will outline the amount of funding available and the areas that will be considered for support. The deadline for receipt of applications will be 1 March. A decision on which applications to recommend to the trustee to fund from the Endowment will be made by the Scientific Advisory Committee and the trustee will advise successful applicants by 31 May. Researchers must provide the Scientific Advisory Committee with a report showing previously funded research has been completed before becoming eligible for potential new funding. Grant application forms see under Grants. 

### Grant Project Eligibility
The endowment supports endeavors in the following areas of interest on Australian lepidoptera:


* Support for visitors or students to curate parts of the ANIC Lepidoptera collection
* Collecting trips designed to obtain material for specific taxonomic studies
* Molecular, morphological and life-history research to generate data for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies
* Provision of cabinets to amateur collectors to ensure proper housing of material collected or on loan from Institutions
* Preparation and printing of scientific publications
* Travel and accommodation for international researchers to work in the ANIC to undertake taxonomic research and/or curatorial work enhancing the scientific value of the collection
* Scholarships to support undergraduate, MSc and PhD students undertaking taxonomic and phylogenetic research.
