# MABA Grants

MABA provides grants to support two key areas in Lepidoptera research: (1) biosystematics, and (2) biodiversity conservation. The **Australian Lepidoptera Research Endowment**, established by Marianne Horak and Douglas Hilton within the Perpetual Foundation, supports taxonomic and phylogenetic research on Australian moths and butterflies by professional and amateur entomologists and to enhance the curation of the Lepidoptera collection at the Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC). The **MABA Biodiversity Fund** was established by Michael Braby on behalf of MABA for the specific purpose of supporting the societyâ€™s environmental objectives on biodiversity conservation, namely to promote and support the conservation of moths and butterflies and their habitats. We have submitted an application to the Register of Environmental Organisations and, if successful, the Fund will be endorsed to receive tax deductible donations (i.e., deductible gift recipient status).
