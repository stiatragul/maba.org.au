The 10th ANIC Moth Meeting was held in Canberra 5-6 February 2022. Although only a small group attended due to COVID-19, it was a great pleasure to see old friends again. The Lepidoptera collection in the ANIC hall came alive with a group of knowledgeable and excited Lepidoptera fans. You Ning Su excelled himself with the group picture in which everybody is duly identified.
