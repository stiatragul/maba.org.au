# MABA ANNUAL EVENT 2023

The inaugural annual MABA event for 2023 will be held at the [Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG)](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/botanic-gardens/) at Black Mountain, Canberra, ACT, Australia, **3-5 November**. 

The event will be free to members, except the dinner on Saturday night. 

Non-members may attend the talks on Saturday but will have to pay an entry fee. We are planning to hold six activities, as follows:

### Friday 3 NOV, 5.00–7.00pm: Social function
Location: CSIRO Black Mountain Library ground floor. 

The social function will also include a scientific art exhibition based on the collection of Lepidoptera art works curated in the rare book collection of the Library. The exhibition will include original paintings by Neville Cayley, George Browning, Ninon Geier and Sybil Monteith that were published in various textbooks on Australian butterflies during the twentieth century. Dinner and drinks will be provided. 

### Friday 3 NOV, 8.00 pm–12.00 am: Light trapping for moths 
Location: Australian National Botanic Gardens

Several different light traps will be set up in gardens near the Black Mountain reserve. Participants are requested to BYO torches and sun-glasses, and to wear sturdy shoes/boots. Those attending the workshop on Sunday afternoon are encouraged to collect material for that activity. The event will be cancelled if weather is wet/storms but may be postponed to Sunday 5 November depending on numbers and interest.

### Saturday 4 NOV, 9.00 am–5.00pm: Talks, AGM and keynote speaker
Location: Australian National Botanic Gardens Theatrette (located opposite the bookstore and visitor centre)

This event will be free to members, but non-members will be charged an entry fee of $50. Morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea will be provided. There will be books on butterflies and moths for sale, and book signing opportunities. We are encouraging members to talk on any subject of Lepidoptera: it is an opportunity for members to share their experiences about rearing / breeding work, field trips and travel, conservation projects, as well as more detailed scientific research being carried in Australasia. A/Prof David J Lohman from the City College of New York, USA will deliver the keynote address. 

### Saturday 4 NOV, 6.30–10.30 pm: Dinner, Belconnen.
