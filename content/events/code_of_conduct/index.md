# Code of Conduct

The society is dedicated to a safe and hospitable environment for everyone attending our events, and consideration and respect is expected. All attendees, members and speakers should refrain from behaviour that is demeaning, discriminatory or harassing. This includes offensive gestures or verbal comments; the sending or sharing of offensive images, videos, emails, texts, or voicemails; deliberate intimidation; stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome attention. Participants asked to stop such behaviour are expected to comply immediately. The society may take any action it deems appropriate in dealing with a participant who engages in demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour, ranging from a simple warning to the offender, expulsion from society events to termination of membership.

The society shall not be responsible for any defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of participants at events, and shall not be held liable for personal injury, property damage, theft or damage of any kind suffered by the participants at or in connection with society events. By registering for and attending any society events, each participant acknowledges that they have read this Policy and Disclaimer, and expressly releases MABA and its officers from liability in connection with society events.
