# Background 

Welcome to Moths and Butterflies Australasia Inc. (MABA). We are a not-for-profit organisation with charitable status that aims to encourage interest in the scientific study, research and conservation of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) in the Australian Region (Australasia). The society was founded in 2021 and provides a forum to unite people with similar interests in moths and butterflies across Australia, New Zealand, and adjacent islands. The society has a broad appeal to a wide range of interest groups, including amateur naturalists, photographers, conservationists and citizen scientists who are passionate about observing, collecting and studying moths and butterflies, not just professional entomologists. Thus, through community engagement we increase connectivity between various people, research institutions and non-government organizations, facilitating networks between experts and promoting collaborations.

# Aims and objectives 

The aims and objectives of MABA are:

To bring together in a scientific forum people of all ages and backgrounds interested in moths and butterflies;

To exchange scientific knowledge, specimens and observations of moths and butterflies in a social and congenial atmosphere;

To compile and disseminate information on the identity, taxonomy and distribution of all species of moths and butterflies, both native and introduced, for the purposes of advancing education, training, biosecurity and evaluation of pest status;

To promote and support the conservation of moths and butterflies and their habitats, and provide information to government agencies and non-government organisations on land use, threatened species and biodiversity for the purpose of advancing the health of the natural environment; 

To lobby for improved funding and training for research on moths and butterflies.
