## Archived Affliated Newsletters

The Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC) Lepidoptera Unit ran a series of informal workshops on moths from 2003â€“2022. 

The workshops were held at ANIC in Canberra every two years, and a total of 10 meetings were held over the 20-year period. One outcome of these meetings was the production of two series of newsletters. 

The first newsletter was the *Moths in Australia* Newsletter of which five issues were produced between 2005 and 2007 coordinated by Ted Martin. Then followed the *ANIC Lepidoptera Newsletter* of which seven were produced between 2015 and 2021 coordinated by Marianne Horak. The newsletters contain a vast amount of history, information and contributions on Australian Lepidoptera; however, because they are not widely available, we have made them accessible on our website for you to enjoy.
